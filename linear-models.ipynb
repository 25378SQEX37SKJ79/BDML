    "###  Multivariate regression\n",
    "\n",
    "It is somewhat complex to be computing regression lines for each strata. We are essentially fitting models like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mbox{E}[R \\mid BB = x_1, \\, HR = x_2] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1(x_2) x_1 + \\beta_2(x_1) x_2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with the slopes for $x_1$ changing for different values of $x_2$ and vice versa. But is there an easier approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "If we take random variability into account, the slopes in the strata don't appear to change much. If these slopes are in fact the same, this implies that $\\beta_1(x_2)$ and $\\beta_2(x_1)$ are constants. This in turn implies that the expectation of runs conditioned on HR and BB can be written like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mbox{E}[R \\mid BB = x_1, \\, HR = x_2] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This model suggests that if the number of HR is fixed at $x_2$, we observe a linear relationship between runs and BB with an intercept of $\\beta_0 + \\beta_2 x_2$. Our exploratory data analysis suggested this. The model also suggests that as the number of HR grows, the intercept growth is linear as well and determined by $\\beta_1 x_1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, referred to as _multivariate regression_, you will often hear people say that the BB slope $\\beta_1$ is _adjusted_ for the HR effect. If the model is correct then confounding has been accounted for. But how do we estimate $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$ from the data? For this, we learn about linear models and least squares estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Least squares estimates {#lse}\n",
    "\n",
    "We have described how if data is bivariate normal then the conditional expectations follow the regression line. The fact that the conditional expectation is a line is not an extra assumption but rather a derived result. However, in practice it is common to explicitly write down a model that describes the relationship between two or more variables using a _linear model_. \n",
    "\n",
    "We note that \"linear\" here does not refer to lines exclusively, but rather to the fact that the conditional expectation is a linear combination of known quantities. In mathematics, when we multiply each variable by a constant and then add them together, we say we formed a linear combination of the variables. For example, $3x - 4y + 5z$ is a linear combination of $x$, $y$, and $z$. We can also add a constant so $2 + 3x - 4y + 5z$ is also linear combination of $x$, $y$, and $z$. \n",
    "\n",
    "So $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2$, is a linear combination of $x_1$ and $x_2$. \n",
    "The simplest linear model is a constant $\\beta_0$; the second simplest is a line $\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x$. If we were to specify a linear model for Galton's data, we would denote the $N$ observed father heights with $x_1, \\dots, x_n$, then we model the $N$ son heights we are trying to predict with: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\varepsilon_i, \\, i=1,\\dots,N. \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $x_i$ is the father's height, which is fixed (not random) due to the conditioning, and $Y_i$ is the random son's height that we want to predict. We further assume that $\\varepsilon_i$ are independent from each other, have expected value 0 and the standard deviation, call it $\\sigma$, does not depend on $i$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the above model, we know the $x_i$, but to have a useful model for prediction, we need $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$. We estimate these from the data. Once we do this, we can predict son's heights for any father's height $x$. We show how to do this in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if we further assume that the $\\varepsilon$ is normally distributed, then this model is exactly the same one we derived earlier by assuming bivariate normal data. A somewhat nuanced difference is that in the first approach we assumed the data was bivariate normal and that the linear model was derived, not assumed. In practice, linear models are just assumed without necessarily assuming normality: the distribution of the $\\varepsilon$s is not specified.  Nevertheless, if your data is bivariate normal, the above linear model holds. If your data is not bivariate normal, then you will need to have other ways of justifying the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreting linear models\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason linear models are popular is that they are interpretable. In the case of Galton's data, we can interpret the data like this: due to inherited genes, the son's height prediction grows by $\\beta_1$ for each inch we increase the father's height $x$. Because not all sons with fathers of height $x$ are of equal height, we need the term $\\varepsilon$, which explains the remaining variability. This remaining variability includes the mother's genetic effect, environmental factors, and other biological randomness. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given how we wrote the model above, the intercept $\\beta_0$ is not very interpretable as it is the predicted height of a son with a father with no height. Due to regression to the mean, the prediction will usually be a bit larger than 0. To make the slope parameter more interpretable, we can rewrite the model slightly as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (x_i - \\bar{x}) + \\varepsilon_i, \\, i=1,\\dots,N \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "with $\\bar{x} = 1/N \\sum_{i=1}^N x_i$ the average of the $x$. In this case $\\beta_0$ represents the height when $x_i = \\bar{x}$, which is the height of the son of an average father.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Least Squares Estimates (LSE)\n",
    "\n",
    "For linear models to be useful, we have to estimate the unknown $\\beta$s. The standard approach in science is to find the values that minimize the distance of the fitted model to the data. The following is called the least squares (LS) equation and we will see it often in this chapter. For Galton's data, we would write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "RSS = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left\\{  y_i - \\left(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i \\right)\\right\\}^2 \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This quantity is called the residual sum of squares (RSS). Once we find the values that minimize the RSS, we will call the values the least squares estimates (LSE) and denote them with $\\hat{\\beta}_0$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_1$. Let's demonstrate this with the previously defined dataset:"
