        "_Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game_ is a book by Michael Lewis about the Oakland Athletics (A's) baseball team and its general manager, the person tasked with building the team, Billy Beane. \n",

        "Traditionally, baseball teams use _scouts_ to help them decide what players to hire. These scouts evaluate players by observing them perform. Scouts tend to favor athletic players with observable physical abilities. For this reason, scouts tend to agree on who the best players are and, as a result, these players tend to be in high demand. This in turn drives up their salaries. \n",
        "\n",
        "From 1989 to 1991, the A's had one of the highest payrolls in baseball. They were able to buy the best players and, during that time, they were one of the best teams. However, in 1995 the A's team owner changed and the new management cut the budget drastically, leaving then general manager, Sandy Alderson, with one of the lowest payrolls in baseball. He could no longer afford the most sought-after players. Alderson began using a statistical approach to find inefficiencies in the market. Alderson was a mentor to Billy Beane, who succeeded him in 1998 and fully embraced data science, as opposed to scouts, as a method for finding low-cost players that data predicted would help the team win. Today, this strategy has been adapted by most baseball teams. As we will see, regression plays a large role in this approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "As motivation for this chapter, we will pretend it is 2002 and try to build a baseball team with a limited budget, just like the A's had to do. To appreciate what you are up against, note that in 2002 the Yankees' payroll of \\$125,928,583 more than tripled the Oakland A's \\$39,679,746: \n",
